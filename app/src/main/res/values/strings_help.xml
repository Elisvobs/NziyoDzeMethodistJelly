    <!-- Splash and Start up -->
    <string name="body1Para1">
        This topic will tell you all you need to know about how the application starts and what you can change.\n
        When the application start, you are shown the Methodist Logo and after that, a hymn is quoted.
        This is just a feature which makes this application unique.

        This might be a slow start to a user and can be easily disabled by going to Settings > General > Show a Himn Verse
        on Splash and then disable it.
    </string>
    <!-- Insert body1shortcut1 -->
    <string name="body1Para3">
        Sometimes after disabling the feature, a user might still feel that the application is taking time to start.
        I have Included a faint Close Button which is always on the top right of the Splash screen.
    </string>
    <!--inserts body1picture2 -->
    <string name="body1Para4">
        The moment you click this button the Splash will end, taking you straight into the Main Screen.\n
        Also, the moment you press the back button while the hymnbook is loading, it will close the whole hymnbook
        ,assuming you did not intend to open the application in the first place.
